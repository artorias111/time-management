# Time Management
Time Management (TM) helps you to keep track of your day-to-day life as a software developer. Using TM you can:

1. Make notes about daily activities
2. Set tasks to be accomplished
3. Print overdue tasks
4. Print the previous workday's activities for Scrum


Features include:

1. Work history analytics
2. Enhanced database maintenance
3. User configuration

Usage:

1. Clone this repository locally on your machine
2. Open the time_management directory in a terminal
3. run main.py

Once opened, something like this should pop up:

                                          
    Good evening <user>. You have 1 overdue items.
